# Tony Elumelu's H1 2023 LinkedIn Analysis

## This project highlights the analysis of Mr Tony Elumelu's engagements on LinkedIn in the first half of 2023. Click [here](https://dannyskillzz.medium.com/tony-elumelus-h1-2023-linkedin-analysis-c9bb4fe6de4) to read full article.

## Gathering the Data

I sourced my data directly from LinkedIn. This was done on Saturday, July 1st, 2023. I wanted to perform a time analysis using the time and days of the week each post was made. So I employed the use of a [tool](https://ollie-boyd.github.io/Linkedin-post-timestamp-extractor/) to help me extract the time and date from every post.

## Engagements

I created a line chart for various engagements to show the month-on-month trend for reactions, comments, and reposts. I also showed the trend for the number of posts made every month.

## Top 5 Posts

I noticed some similarities in the top 5 posts based on engagements. The top post with 37K engagements was a throwback post to TOE’s NYSC days in Sokoto. Another throwback post to age 34 as CEO of Standard Trust Bank came as the №3 post in terms of engagements.

A birthday post of Oge, TOE’s first daughter, came in second place among the top 5; and another birthday post (video) of TOE himself came in 4th place. Coming in 5th place among the top 5 was a video post on an interview with BBC News Africa.

## Time Series Analysis

I also took out the time to make good use of the timestamp data I extracted to analyze the number of posts made and the total engagements gained with respect to days of the week and specific timeframes of posting. I achieved this using the SWITCH function (DAX) on Power BI to return the days of the week and time groups (using a 6-hour timeframe) on separate columns respectively.

## Remarks

Some of the insights I generated are stated below:

- **Best Performing Month:** The best performing month in terms of engagements is March. This is because this month had the highest number of comments and the second highest number of reactions, despite being one of the months with the least number of posts made.
- **Throwback Posts:** Out of the Top 5 Posts, two posts were throwback posts. This indicates that throwback posts have high tendency of generating more numbers in engagements when posted on LinkedIn.
- **Day of the week with highest engagement:** Wednesday got the highest number in engagements (95K) even though it was one of the days with the second least number of posts made (5 posts).
- **Time of the day with highest engagement:** Over 50% of the posts were made between 12PM to 6PM (WAT) with a total engagement of 235.2K. 6PM to 12AM (WAT) may not be the best timeframe to make a LinkedIn post as this timeframe generated 44.7K engagements as compared to equal number of posts made between 6AM to 12PM (WAT) which generated 73.2K engagements. It is safe to say the best time to make a post is between 12PM to 6PM (WAT) or between 6AM to 12PM (WAT).
